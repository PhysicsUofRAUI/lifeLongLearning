# lifeLongLearning
The website that is located at lifelonglearning.rocks is created from this code.

## Current work
### Testing
Writing tests to cover the entire website. Below is a list of everything that is to be tested.
- Forms: Do they work?
- Edit View: Loads, actually edits the db correctly, blocks not logged in user
- Delete Views: Loads, actually deletes the entry, blocks not logged in users
- Add Views: Loads, actually adds the entry, blocks not logged in users
- Display Views: Loads, returns the correct list of entries, does not block users that are not logged in

### Admin View
Creating a view so that those with admin login can easily find the edit, delete, and add views.

### Edit Worksheet View
Creating a view to allow those who want to edit the worksheets they have inputted can do so without having to go to the server and edit them.
