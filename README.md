## Current work
### Adding an Author Account
An author account has been added!

### Adding a Learner Account
A learner account will be similar to an author account but for learners. Learners will not have to be approved by the admin, so they will be able to sign themselves up. Until marking is made there will not be much benefit to having a user account. Possibly adding the ability for users to favourite worksheets could be implemented easily and that could be added to the user dashboard as a start.

The user will set a screen name, a real name, email, and password when they sign up. The learner will also be asked if they want to subscribe to the newsletter when they sign up. At the moment their is not much purpose for having learners, but to introduce marking it will be needed.

### Marking Feature
This will allow users to pay authors to mark a worksheet. Authors will be able to mark any worksheet that they have listed if they have said they will mark it. Learners will request it to be marked by paying up front for it (or entering a smart contract), but the author will not get the payment until the author submits the marked worksheet.

On the learner dashboard the learner will be able to see all worksheets that have been submitted for marking and be able to submit another for marking if they want to. On the author dashboard a list of all worksheets that have been submitted for marking will exist and the author will have an option to click and upload a marked worksheet.

If a user/learner is upset with their marking (inadequate, not enough feedback etc) they can email support/admin with their argument. Admin will take those issues to the author and discuss how it can be improved. If the accusations are particularly egregious, or happen often, and can be verified the author will be removed from the platform.

### Geo tagging worksheets
This will add a new tag / category relation to a database entry. Either a new table will have to be created or some way to enter geographic locations like ‘Canada’, ‘Saskatchewan’, or ‘Melfort’ will have to be added. It should also be possible that multiple tags can be added. For instance a worksheet could be relevant to ‘Melfort’ and ‘Canada’ as a whole.

I think that having this functionality is important, because in textbooks places that are not relevant to many people are mentioned or no places are mentioned at all. I think learners will appreciate having content that references locations that they recognize.

### Other stuff
There is more work that I have thought of described at the following link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_9SmuRiFYpck5_0jZc0jdwnpJSvrbKLC?usp=sharing.

Everything that was called a 'small story' will be added as an issue shortly.
